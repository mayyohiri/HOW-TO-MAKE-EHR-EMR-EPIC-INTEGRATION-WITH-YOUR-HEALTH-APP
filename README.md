If you have heard about EHR/EMR integration but need to know how to integrate it into your health application, this article is for you.

The health tech industry is booming, and many healthcare professionals are now gravitating towards using IT to make their activities easy while delivering outstanding service. [According to Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1154994/number-us-fitness-health-app-users/), about 36% of US citizens used fitness applications as of 2022. 

Many health application owners are now willing to integrate EHR/EMR epic APIs with their health Apps to get easy access to a centralized database that will ensure they deliver excellent customer service. This article explains everything you need to know about [integrating Epic EMR/EHR systems](https://theappsolutions.com/blog/how-to/how-to-integrate-your-health-app-with-epic-ehremr/) with health applications.

## What is Epic Software?

Epic Software refers to those solutions that Doctors and other health-related professionals use in accessing and tracking patient medical data. They use the electronic medical record from the Epic app to improve their services, such as determining the right drug to give the patient and tracking their health status.

## What is EHR/EMR Integration?
Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Electronic Medical Records (EMR) are two major record systems used in healthcare. While EMR contains medical data inputted by a single doctor or healthcare provider, EHR includes the complete medical record of a patient, which various doctors or healthcare providers have updated.

EHR/EMR integration involves connecting your healthcare applications to EMR and EHR medical record systems through an epic API to ensure that doctors and other healthcare providers can access them through your healthcare application. Healthcare professionals and firms are already leveraging this to ease their service delivery, and the EHR market is seeing a huge adoption recently. [According to reports](https://www.selecthub.com/medical-software/emr/electronic-medical-records-future-emr-trends/), the global EHR sector value was $28.1 billion in 2022, and the market is expected to hit $38.5 billion in 2030. 

### Does Epic have an API?
You can use several Epic APIs in integrating your application with the EHR/EMR medical record system. Some techniques you can employ to connect your application to the EHR/EMR record system are HL7, middlewares, FHIR API, and a custom EHR integration module created by your developer.

## How to Integrate Your Health App with Epic EMR/EHR Systems?

The first step in integrating your app with the EMR/EHR system is identifying the server on which your application is and then checking the site where you are willing to retrieve the records and its compatibility with the EMR/EHR system.

You are then required to create an account on Uscdi.epic.com to get the API key. Verifying your identity is also crucial, as this helps in securing data.

To ensure your application doesn't eventually cease getting data from the system, check the API for all the essential endpoints. The API key will be shown on the site, and you will conduct tests to verify if all the endpoints are properly functioning.

Include the API call in your application code and test to ensure the whole App is working properly. You can now access the EMR/EHR system through your application.

## The Benefits of Integration EHR/EMR

Connecting your application to this record system has many perks. This is why healthcare service providers are willing to adopt this modern method of easing medical services. The advantages of integrating EHR/EMR with your health app include

### Quick Access to Medical Records 
The introduction of the EHR/EMR record system has presented doctors and physicians with a technology that allows them to easily get their patients' health records with just a few clicks. This will enable them to deliver better healthcare services and determine the right medication to give patients while managing time.

### Cost management 
Using the EHR/EMR system for your health software will help you manage the amount you will spend on getting a database that stores patients' medical history. This is because the developer does not need to write much code if you are using Epic APIs, reducing the amount you will spend on getting a record system for your application.

### Scalability 
EHR/EMR integration allows you to change the size of your application database to satisfy any healthcare application data need. This means it can handle database management for varying healthcare organizations with different sizes and database size needs.

## Who Needs Epic EMR/EHR Integration?
Epic EMR/EHR integration can be used by healthcare organizations that offer remote healthcare services such as telemedicine. If the EMR/EHR medical record systems are integrated into a telemedicine application, remote healthcare providers do not need to ask patients to collect their health information from previous healthcare facilities, as the patient's medical information will be readily accessible.

Epic EMR/EHR integration is also meant for you if you build an application that helps track patients' health status by examining and reviewing their medical records and information.
## Which Healthcare Organizations don't Need Epic EHR/EMR Integration?
Epic EMR/EHR integration is not meant for your healthcare app if it requires more than viewing medical or health information, as Epic APIs do not allow for the editing of records. 

This form of integration is also not meant for you if your application requires deep data analysis. Epic EMR/EHR is also not meant for you if your application is patient-based, as the EHR/EMR records are just for medical professionals.
## Conclusion
Healthcare professionals are increasingly adopting technology to ease their service delivery. You may be missing out if you have yet to build an application that is connected to the EMR/EHR system for your healthcare organization.
